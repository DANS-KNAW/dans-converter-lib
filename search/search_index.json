DESCRIPTION \u00b6 This library provides a set of ready-to-use converters for Jackson and JPA. Two types of converters There are two types of converters in this library: Jackson and JPA. They have been put in one library for convenience, but they are not interchangeable. Jackson \u00b6 These converters are used on classes that represent JSON objects and are serialized/deserialized by Jackson, typically used in configuration files and DTOs (Data Transfer Objects). Example usage: public class MyPojo { @JsonProperty(\"size\") @JsonDeserialize(converter = StringByteSizeConverter.class) private long sizeInBytes; } This allows you to specify the byte size of a field in a JSON object as a string, e.g. \"1MB\" , \"1GB\" , etc. The Jackson convert are located in the nl.knaw.dans.convert.jackson package. JPA \u00b6 These converters are used on classes that represent entities in a JPA (Java Persistence API) context, typically used in databases. Example usage: @Entity(name = \"MyEntity\") @Table(name = \"my_entity\") public class MyEntity { @Convert(converter = UriConverter.class) private URI uri; } The JPA converters are located in the nl.knaw.dans.convert.jpa package. This allows you to store a URI in a database as a string instead of as a serialized object. INSTALLATION \u00b6 To use this library in a Maven-based project: Include in your pom.xml a declaration for the DANS maven repository: <repositories> <!-- possibly other repository declarations here ... --> <repository> <id>DANS</id> <releases> <enabled>true</enabled> </releases> <url>https://maven.dans.knaw.nl/releases/</url> </repository> </repositories> Include a dependency on this library. <dependency> <groupId>nl.knaw.dans</groupId> <artifactId>dans-converter-lib</artifactId> <version>{version}</version> <!-- <=== FILL LIBRARY VERSION TO USE HERE --> </dependency>","title":"Manual"},{"location":"#manual","text":"Library with JavaBean validator annotations.","title":"MANUAL"},{"location":"#description","text":"This library provides a set of ready-to-use converters for Jackson and JPA.
